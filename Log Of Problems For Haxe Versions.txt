Gonna Use 4.1.5 version of haxe first to see if it causes any problem with building 

if it cause problems im going to try a different version of haxe and remove the old

okay so first things first to check and prevent is to check the apt cache of which version for haxe 
but for some reason when i checked it 
there were only two version out of the whole binary and dispotrory


As of writing this now 
ShadowEngine 4.2.4 and i dont think it will compile 
with anything below that version

KadeEngine Uses 4.1.5 But it will cause errors with compiling IF USED with the lastest version that why it does not use it but i think it got removed off repository

What I DID
\\\\\\\\\\\
i basically did this by doing package for example haxe then add equals in middle then the version package 
It Should Looks Like This
-------------------------
apt-get haxe=version 
-------------------------
ps
dont be a moron and actually type the word version but the version number for that support the fnf engine and which version its made for

just find it in the repository for haxe which im using linux 
i used the command line for 4.2.4 which is for shadowengine



-------------------
I got it working for html5 
I made a .gitmodules for the root of the repository 
and used these code

[submodule "FNF-PsychEngine"] 
  path = FNF-PsychEngine 
  url = https://github.com/DerpySlurrpe/DsychEngine
  i added that in the .gitmodules files and it work for some reason
  
  
  it failed building without the files because of this 
  
  I GOT IT TO WORK IF I 
  GIT RM --CACHED -f EVERYTIME WHEN I GIT ADD .
